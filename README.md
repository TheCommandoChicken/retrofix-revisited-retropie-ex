# Retrofix Revisited (RetroPie Version)
This is a port of the Retrofix theme by [20GotoTen](https://github.com/20GotoTen) for the version of EmulationStation used in [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/).  

**The original theme idea was designed and created by 20GotoTen. [anthonycaccese](https://github.com/anthonycaccese) made changes to the XML to make the theme compatible with RetroPie and added updated artwork. The original version of the theme can be found [here](https://github.com/20GotoTen/es-theme-retrofix). For more informaiton see the parent repo.**

## **Additional Notes**

### Versions for other ES forks:
* If you use Batocera... then you should use the original version by 20GotoTen [here](https://github.com/20GotoTen/es-theme-retrofix).
* If you use ES-DE... then this version of the theme will work out of the box with that distribution.  When used with ES-DE the theme comes with additional support for navigation sound sets.  I'm also working on a version to support the 2.0 theme engine that the ES-DE team is working on and will post that here when available.
